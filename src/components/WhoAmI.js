          Hi! I'm a passionate full stack developer with a love for building impactful web applications. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies. My journey in tech has taken me from frontend design to backend logic, and I thrive on creating seamless user experiences.

        <p>
          I believe in clean code, collaboration, and always pushing the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tools, reading tech blogs, or contributing to open source projects.
